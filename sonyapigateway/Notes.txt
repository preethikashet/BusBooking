1. Open Microservice one and note down microservice name and the request mapping url
2. Note Down the endpoints to be called from the API Gateway with the exact signature
3.GO to the JWT token microservice inside the authenticated request mapping of a controller(Create a controller with this request mapping)
4.Create Interface for the microservice one with the annotation @FeignClient(Give the microservice name and the requestmapping)
5. Add Abstract methods that we have noted down for the microservice one
6.Enable FeignClient in the main
7.In the Controller which is authenticated inside the JWT token, add autowired for interface
8.Create any endpoint which matches the microservice endpoint and call the microservice using the autowired object
9. Start the discovery server first, then start the API gateway and other microservice
10. Test the application
